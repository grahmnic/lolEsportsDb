##Team: 
> You could view teams and what players were on each team. You could also view each player individually but I couldn't find an image of that ;(
![team](./sample/team.png)

##Tournmanent: 
> You could view tournmanets which were part of regions. If you scrolled down you could view the records of each team competing in that tournmanent and even view match history of individual games. Again .pngs not found, but the code's there!
